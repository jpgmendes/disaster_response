Disaster Response Project

This project is an introduction to Disaster Response Analysis.

First we're analyzing messages sent by population who suffered a disaster (hurricane or earthquake are examples)


INSTALLATION

You just need to download the .db which are the dataset to input in the model.
process_data.py is the file where the messages are processed.
train_classifier.py is the file to train the model (it can take several hours considering the grid search performed).

Dependencies:

    python (>= 3.6) https://www.python.org/downloads/
    pandas (>= 1.0.0) https://pandas.pydata.org/
    nltk (>= 3.5) https://www.nltk.org/
    scikit-learn (>= 0.23.2) https://scikit-learn.org

Project motivation

For this project we're trying to predict the needs from population in the middle of disaster and connect people who offers help to people who needs help.


You're free to use and to contribute to the development of this project.
